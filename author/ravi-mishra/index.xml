      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Before beginning my doctoral studies, I earned my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Haven and my B-Tech in Mechanical (Automobile) Engineering from KIIT University, India. I have over two and a half years of professional experience in automotive systems, mechatronics, robotics, and manufacturing process optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My professional background includes roles such as Process Engineer Intern at Thai Summit America Corporation, where I specialized in process simulation, die tryouts, and downtime reduction, and Service and ADAS Calibration Engineer, where I resolved complex vehicle system challenges and enhanced diagnostic efficiency. I have also conducted academic projects in areas such as PID-controlled master-slave robotic arms and hierarchical lattice structure design via additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on magnetoactive soft materials, smart materials, additive manufacturing, generative design, topology optimization, lightweight structural design, and soft robotics. I aim to integrate advanced materials, computational design, and precision manufacturing to create high-performance solutions for next-generation mobility, biomedical, and robotic applications. Currently, I am working on the multiscale modeling and design of functional soft materials, with emphasis on magnetoactive polymers for adaptive structures, actuators, and soft robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
