Despite its potential, clinical implementation faces significant challenges due to uncertainties in the thermophysical properties, nanoparticle distribution, and magnetic particle parameters, which can compromise the precision and efficacy of the treatment. This article introduces an information-theoretic framework for optimal experimental design in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia to address these challenges. By accounting for uncertainties in key parameters, such as tissue thermal conductivity, blood perfusion rate, and nanoparticle anisotropy constant, the framework maximizes mutual information between the observed data and model parameters, enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. A surrogate 1D model is employed to reduce computational complexity, allowing the identification of optimal magnetic field amplitudes across diverse initial conditions and scenarios, including single and multiple uncertain parameters. The results highlight the robustness of the optimization approach, demonstrating consistent convergence to a stable solution that is expected to enable precise temperature measurement and effective parameter recovery. This study underscores the potential for mutual information-based optimization to advance the planning of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia treatment and provides a foundation for future experimental and clinical applications.","tags":["Optimal Experimental Design","Information Theory","Magnetic Nanoparticle Hyperthermia"],"title":"An Information-Theoretic Framework for Optimal Experimental Design in Magnetic Nanoparticle Hyperthermia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Code information Github link: neural_operator\nDocumentation:\nReadme Developers:\nPrashant K.

Kinetic relations and local energy balance for LEFM from a nonlocal peridynamic model In this work, we carefully looked at the peridynamic energy associated with the process zone. We recovered the kinetic relation for crack tip velocity for the mode-I crack problem. It is based on more theoretical work; see Lipton and Jha 2021, Jha and Lipton 2020. This is joint work with Dr. R. Lipton.\nSome interesting simulations are shown next.\nSimulation of Mode-I propagation.

A priori error analysis and well-posedness of nonlinear peridynamic models At Louisiana State University, I had spent a good amount of time working on a priori error estimates for finite-difference and finite-element discretization of and well-posedness of nonlinear peridynamic models. This was under the guidance of my adviser Dr. R. Lipton. On this topic, we have published several journal articles and few book chapters, see publication page.\nWe know that peridynamics regularizes the discontinuity; the sharp edge of discontinuity is replaced with the softening zone containing material points with large strains (classical strain). Away from the softening zone, the strains are smaller. Typically the size of the softening zone is proportional to the nonlocal length scale. As the nonlocal length scale goes to zero, the softening zone localizes to a sharp crack. To demonstrate this, we consider a setup shown in Figure 1. In Figure 2, we plot the damage for three different nonlocal length scales at two times. We see that for a smaller nonlocal length scale, the softening zone indicated by the red region is smaller than that of a bigger nonlocal length scale. In Figure 3, we put the plots of three horizons on top of each other, and we see the localization of the softening zone.\nFigure 1: Setup for localization of softening zone. More details preprint, section 6 Figure 2: Damage in material with three horizons at two times. Figure 3: Softening zone of three horizons when placed on top of each other. Light yellow, light orange, and red correspond to smaller, intermediate, and larger horizons. As the horizon is getting smaller softening zone is shrinking to a very thin region, and ultimately in the limit, it will tend to sharp crack. 3. Model development In this article, we proposed a bond-based peridynamic model with memory effect. If the material is subjected to cyclic loading, with each cycle deforming the material beyond some critical strain, it will continue to lose stiffness in every loading cycle. This effect is simulated using the temporal nonlocal force (material strength at a current time depends on the history) in the proposed model.\n","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"fb071828d56dfff31f2912e321386ace","permalink":"https://ceadpx.github.io/project/fracture-mechanics/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fracture-mechanics/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis and application of peridynamics","tags":["Peridynamics","Nonlocal Methods","Fracture Mechanics","Multiphysics","Numerical Method"],"title":"Analysis and application of peridynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://ceadpx.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Activities 1. Goal-Oriented A-Posteriori Estimation of Model Error as an Aid to Parameter Estimation (with Dr. Oden) We consider the problem of estimating modeling error in boundary – and initial–value problems characterized by partial differential equations (PDEs), with the understanding that the purpose of the prediction, the ultimate goal of the simulation, is to compute specific quantities of interest: the “QoIs”. Mathematically the QoIs are functionals of solutions to the so-called primal or forward problem. We review the theory of goal-oriented a-posteriori estimation of modeling error “Oden and Prudhomme, JCP 182.2 (2002): 496-515”. Here we add to this theory a new ingredient: we explore the question of can such a-posterior estimates of error between a high-fidelity model of a physical system in which parameters are not known with precision, and a surrogate, low-fidelity models with known parameters, be used to infer properties and parameters of the high-fidelity system? We developed a Bayesian framework for studying such issues based on goal-oriented QoI-error estimates, and we give examples in which this approach is very successful.\nThis work is published in JCP and can be found in this link: Jha and Oden (2022).\n2. Residual-based error correction for neural operator accelerated infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (with Lianghao, Thomas, Dr. Oden, and Omar) We explore using neural operators, or neural network representations of nonlinear maps between function spaces, to accelerate infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs) with models governed by nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The computational cost of BIPs can be drastically reduced if the large number of PDE solves required for posterior characterization are replaced with evaluations of trained neural operators. However, reducing error in the resulting BIP solutions via reducing the approximation error of the neural operators in training can be challenging and unreliable. To reliably deploy neural operators in BIPs, we consider a strategy for enhancing the performance of neural operators: correcting the prediction of a trained neural operator by solving a linear variational problem based on the PDE residual. We show that a trained neural operator with error correction can achieve a quadratic reduction of its approximation error, all while retaining substantial computational speedups of posterior sampling when models are governed by highly nonlinear PDEs. The strategy is applied to two numerical examples of BIPs based on a nonlinear reaction–diffusion problem and deformation of hyperelastic materials.\nThis work is published in JCP and can be found in this link: Cao et al.

Corrector operator to enhance accuracy and reliability of neural operator surrogates of nonlinear variational boundary-value problems (with Dr. Oden) This work focuses on developing methods for approximating the solution operators of a class of parametric partial differential equations via neural operators. Neural operators have several challenges, including the issue of generating appropriate training data, cost-accuracy trade-offs, and nontrivial hyperparameter tuning. The unpredictability of the accuracy of neural operators impacts their applications in downstream problems of inference, optimization, and control. A framework is proposed based on the linear variational problem that gives the correction to the prediction furnished by neural operators. The operator associated with the corrector problem is referred to as the corrector operator. Numerical results involving a nonlinear diffusion model in two dimensions with PCANet-type neural operators show almost two orders of increase in the accuracy of approximations when neural operators are corrected using the proposed scheme. Further, topology optimization involving a nonlinear diffusion model is considered to highlight the limitations of neural operators and the efficacy of the correction scheme. Optimizers with neural operator surrogates are seen to make significant errors (as high as 80 percent). However, the errors are much lower (below 7 percent) when neural operators are corrected following the proposed method.\nPreprint of the work can be found in this link: Jha and Oden (2023). This work is a culmination of our efforts in using goal-oriented a-posteriori error estimates in Bayesian inference in Jha and Oden (2022) and Cao et al.

Neural operators have several challenges, including the issue of generating appropriate training data, cost-accuracy trade-offs, and nontrivial hyperparameter tuning. The unpredictability of the accuracy of neural operators impacts their applications in downstream problems of inference, optimization, and control. A framework based on the linear variational problem that gives the correction to the prediction furnished by neural operators is considered based on earlier work in JCP 486 (2023) 112104. The operator, called Residual-based Error Corrector Operator or simply Corrector Operator, associated with the corrector problem is analyzed further. Numerical results involving a nonlinear reaction–diffusion model in two dimensions with PCANet-type neural operators show almost two orders of increase in the accuracy of approximations when neural operators are corrected using the correction scheme. Further, topology optimization involving a nonlinear reaction–diffusion model is considered to highlight the limitations of neural operators and the efficacy of the correction scheme. Optimizers with neural operator surrogates are seen to make significant errors (as high as 80 percent). However, the errors are much lower (below 7 percent) when neural operators are corrected.","tags":["Neural Networks","Neural operators","Variational Formulation","Partial Differential Equations","Topology Optimization","Computational Methods"],"title":"Residual-based error corrector operator to enhance accuracy and reliability of neural operator surrogates of nonlinear variational boundary-value problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K.

Starting from the atomic scale with a discrete distribution of dipoles, we obtain the continuum limit of the electrostatic energy; the continuum energy depends on the geometric parameters that define the nanostructure, such as the pitch and twist of the helical nanotubes and the curvature of the thin film. We find that the limiting energy is local in nature. This can be rationalized by noticing that the decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run over one and two dimensions, and is also consistent with prior work on dimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit. However, an interesting contrast between the discrete-to-continuum approach and the continuum dimension reduction approaches is that the limit energy in the latter depends only on the normal component of the dipole field, whereas in the discrete-to-continuum approach, both tangential and normal components of the dipole field contribute to the limit energy..","tags":["Continuum Limit","Nanostructures","Electrostatics","Dipole-Dipole Interaction","Multiscale Methods"],"title":"Discrete-to-Continuum Limits of Long-Range Electrical Interactions in Nanostructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lianghao Cao","Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry","Prashant K.

The estimates of error in QoIs are used to define likelihood functions in Bayesian inversion analysis. A standard Bayesian approach is employed to compute the posterior distribution of model parameters of high-fidelity models. As applications, parameters in a quasi-linear second-order elliptic boundary-value problem (BVP) are calibrated using a second-order linear elliptic BVP.

The overall strategy is posed in the framework of the Quasicontinuum multiscale method; specifically, the use of a finite-element inspired kinematic description enables a significant reduction in the large number of degrees of freedom to describe the atomic positions. The key advance of this work is a method for the efficient and accurate treatment of nonlocal electrostatic charge-charge interactions without restrictions on the geometry or boundary conditions. Electrostatic interactions are long-range with slow decay, and hence require consideration of all pairs of charges making a brute-force approach computationally prohibitive. The method proposed here accounts for the exact charge-charge interactions in the near-field and uses a coarse-grained approximation in the far-field. The coarse-grained approximation and the associated errors are rigorously derived based on the limit of a finite body with a small periodic lengthscale, thereby enabling the errors in the approximation to be controlled to a desired tolerance. The method is applied to a simple model of Gallium Nitride and it is shown that electrostatic interactions can be approximated with a desired level of accuracy using the proposed methodology.","tags":["Multiscale Modeling","Ionic Solids","Electrostatics","Quasicontinuum Method"],"title":"Atomic-to-Continuum Multiscale Modeling of Defects in Crystals with Nonlocal Electrostatic Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K.

Mutual information is employed to measure the information content of the HP measurements with respect to the first-order exchange kinetics of the pyruvate conversion to lactate. Flip angles of the pulse sequence acquisition are optimized with respect to the mutual information. A time-varying flip angle scheme leads to a higher parameter optimization that can further improve the quantitative value of mutual information over a constant flip angle scheme. However, the constant flip angle scheme, 35 and 28 degrees for pyruvate and lactate measurements, leads to an accuracy and precision comparable to the variable flip angle schemes obtained from our method. Combining the comparable performance and practical implementation, optimized pyruvate and lactate flip angles of 35 and 28 degrees, respectively, are recommended.","tags":["Computational Modeling","Optimal Experimental Design","Mutual Information","Uncertainty Quantification","Pharmacokinetic Models","Partial Differential Equations"],"title":"Mutual-Information Based Optimal Experimental Design for Hyperpolarized 13C-Pyruvate MRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Develop efficient and parallel computational methods for class of nonlocal models such as Peridynamics and nonlocal diffusion equations\nActivities 1.

Analysis of a new multispecies tumor growth model coupling 3D phase-fields with a 1D vascular network This is joint work with Dr. J. T. Oden at UT Austin and colleagues at the Technical University of Munich. In this work, we study the 3D-1D model of tumor growth that couples the flow and transport of nutrients in the vessel network with nutrient and tumor evolution in the tissue domain. In particular, we looked at the well-posedness of the resulting highly coupled multi-dimension nonlinear model. See the article.\nFigure 1 below shows progression of tumor towards nutrient rich artery on the right. In top row, the contour $\\phi_T = 0.8$ plot of total tumor (sum of prolific, hypoxic, and necrotic) species volume fraction is shown.

Modeling and simulation of vascular tumors embedded in dynamically evolving capillary networks This work takes the work in the paper above one step further. In this work, we add the angiogenesis effect to the model. Angiogenesis is a phenomenon through which nutrient-starved tumor cells release unique molecules collectively called TAF (Tumor Angiogenesis Factor), which co-opt the blood vessels in the vicinity to grow towards the tumor colony and supply nutrients. We recently submitted the work for review, see article.\nFigure 2 demonstrates the angiogenesis effect and simultaneous tumor growth. Figure 3 shows the quantity of interests such as total tumor $\\phi_T$, prolific $\\phi_P$, hypoxic $\\phi_H$, and necrotic $\\phi_N$ masses with or without angiogenesis. Since angiogenesis is stochastic, we run the simulation multiple times to capture the variation in QoIs.

Application and extension of the 3D-1D model of tumor growth Next, we are interested in developing a tumor growth model to predict treatment responses and metastasis. For both of these problems, it is necessary to model the coupled flow in tissue and vasculature. We are extending the model to include the flow of drugs in vessels and tissue and its effect on tumor growth.\nWhile our work so far has been concerned with algorithmic development and abstract simulations that highlight the key capabilities of the model, we are also interested in the model’s calibration using MRI data. Towards this, we are working with experts at the Center for Computational Oncology for the application of the multi-dimensional model to breast cancer. The vasculature, flow parameters, initial tumor region in our model will be based on MRI data.\nIt is known that the vessels formed as a result of angiogenesis are leaky and weak; the mechanical forces in the tissue microenvironment plays are role in the modification and destruction of these vessels. The mechanical effects are also observed in the growth of the tumor. We are also interested in adding a mechanical component to the model and coupling the mechanical forces with vessels’ displacement and tumor growth.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"14373fbd2c5edb2a4810f4c978554ce4","permalink":"https://ceadpx.github.io/project/tumor-modeling/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tumor-modeling/","section":"project","summary":"Development and analysis of models of tumor growth, angiogenesis, drug therapy, and metastasis","tags":["Tumor Modeling","Angiogenesis","Computational Oncology","Multiphysics Modeling"],"title":"Modeling tumor growth, angiogenesis, drug-therapy, metastasis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Activities 1. Development of a high-fidelity model for granular media Taking the earlier research on peridynamics for granular media forward, we have developed the Peridynamics-DEM high-fidelity model that can handle arbitrarily shaped particles and particle breakage. Traditional models based on DEM (Discrete Element Method) can not handle the particles with arbitrary shapes and deformation of individual particles. Extension of DEM based method to overcome these challenges is possible. However, it is not trivial. PeriDEM model proposed in Jha et al 2021 uses peridynamics for deformation of individual particles. In the model, the contact forces between two particles act at the level of discretization. Because contact forces are applied to discretized nodes (within a small distance) of two particles, particles can see the local boundary; thus, the model can accurately simulate the locking effects.\nFigure 1: Two-particle test. The top particle is given initial velocity. The plot shows the damage upon contact for different initial velocities—both particles made of the same materials. Damage above 1 indicates the onset of failure. From Jha et al 2021 Figure 2: Same as Figure 1, but now the particle on top is stronger than the bottom particle.

In nonlocal models, in contrast to the local model, such as the wave and heat partial differential equations, the material interacts with neighboring points on a larger-length scale compared to the mesh discretization. In developing a fully distributed solver, the interaction over a length scale greater than mesh size introduces additional data dependencies among the compute nodes and communication bottleneck. In this work, we carefully look at these challenges in the context of nonlocal models; to keep the presentation specific to the computational issues, we consider a nonlocal heat equation in a 2d setting. In particular, the distributed framework we propose pays greater attention to the bottleneck of data communication and the dynamic balancing of loads among nodes with varying compute capacity. For load balancing, we propose a novel framework that assesses the compute capacity of nodes and dynamically balances the load so that the idle time among nodes is minimal. Our framework relies heavily on HPX library, an asynchronous many-task run time system. We present several results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","tags":["Computational Science","Algorithms","Software","Parallel Computing"],"title":"Load Balancing for Distributed Nonlocal Models Within Asynchronous Many-Task Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marvin Fritz","Prashant K.

Additionally, the model includes erosion of the extracellular matrix, interstitial flow, and coupled flow in blood vessels and tissue. We employ continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn–Hilliard type phase-field models of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale version of Darcy’s law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by Poiseuille flow, and Starling’s law is applied to model the mass transfer in and out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is orchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factors (TAFs); blood vessels grow towards the increasing TAFs concentrations. This process is not deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due to the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, makes the growth of tumors stochastic. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a variety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the model and its ability to generate satellite tumors. Simulations of the effects of angiogenesis on tumor growth are presented as well as sample-independent features of cancer.","tags":["Computational Oncology","Mathematical Modeling","Angiogenesis","Multidimensional Models"],"title":"Modeling and Simulation of Vascular Tumors Embedded in Evolving Capillary Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David A.

Elucidating particulate media’s behavior in concert with particle attrition (i.e., particle wear and subsequent particle fragmentation) is essential for predicting the performance and increasing the efficiency of engineering systems using such media. Discrete element method (DEM) based techniques can describe the interaction between particles but cannot model intra-particle deformation, especially intra-particle fracture. On the other hand, peridynamics provides the means to account for intra-particle deformation and fracture due to contact forces between particles. The present study proposes a hybrid model referred to as PeriDEM that combines the advantages of peridynamics and DEM. The model parameters can be tuned to achieve desired DEM contact forces, damping effects, and intra-particle stiffness. Two particle impacts and compressive behavior of multi-particle systems are thoroughly investigated. The model can account for any arbitrarily shaped particle in general. Spherical, hexagonal, and non-convex particle shapes are simulated in the present study. The effect of mesh resolution on intra-particle peridynamics is explicitly studied. The proposed hybrid model opens a new avenue to explore the complicated interactions encountered in discrete particle dynamics that involve the formation of force chains, particle interlocking, particle attrition, wear, and the eventual breakage.","tags":["Granular Media Mechanics","Mechanics","Peridynamics","Fracture Mechanics","Particle Breakage","Particle Interlocking","Deformable Particles"],"title":"Peridynamics-Based Discrete Element Method (PeriDEM) Model of Granular Systems Involving Breakage of Arbitrarily Shaped Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K.

Through this shift of increasing cores per node, a new programming model with focus on handling of the fine-grain parallelism with increasing amount of cores per computational node is needed. Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) run time systems represent a paradigm for addressing the fine-grain parallelism. They handle the increasing amount of threads per node and concurrency. HPX, a open source C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency, is one AMT which is conforming to the C++ standard. Motivated by the impressive performance of asynchronous task-based parallelism through HPX to N-body problem and astrophysics simulation, in this work, we consider its application to the Peridynamics theory. Peridynamics is a non-local generalization of continuum mechanics tailored to address discontinuous displacement fields arising in fracture mechanics. Peridynamics requires considerable computing resources, owing to its non-local nature of formulation, offering a scope for improved computing performance via asynchronous task-based parallelism. Our results show that HPX-based peridynamic computation is scalable, and the scalability is in agreement with the theory. In addition to the scalability, we also show the validation results and the mesh convergence results. For the validation, we consider implicit time integration and compare the result with the classical continuum mechanics (CCM) (peridynamics under small deformation should give similar results as CCM). For the mesh convergence, we consider explicit time integration and show that the results are in agreement with theoretical claims in previous works.","tags":["Peridynamics","Fracture Mechanics","Software"],"title":"An Asynchronous and Task-Based Implementation of Peridynamics Utilizing HPX—the C++ Standard Library for Parallelism and Concurrency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant K.

We consider state-based peridynamic models where the force at a material point is due to both the strain between two points and the change in volume inside the domain of the nonlocal interaction. The pairwise interactions between points are mediated by a bond potential of multi-well type while multi-point interactions are associated with the volume change mediated by a hydrostatic strain potential. The hydrostatic potential can either be a quadratic function, delivering a linear force–strain relation, or a multi-well type that can be associated with the material degradation and cavitation. We first show the well-posedness of the peridynamic formulation and that peridynamic evolutions exist in the Sobolev space $H^2$. We show that the finite element approximations converge to the $H^2$ solutions uniformly as measured in the mean square norm.

We work within the small deformation setting, and the model is developed within a state-based peridynamic formulation. At each instant of the evolution, we identify the softening zone where strains lie above the strength of the material. We show that deformation discontinuities associated with flaws larger than the length scale of nonlocality $δ$ can become unstable and grow. An explicit inequality is found that shows that the volume of the softening zone goes to zero linearly with the length scale of nonlocal interaction. This scaling is consistent with the notion that a softening zone of width proportional to $δ$ converges to a sharp fracture set as the length scale of nonlocal interaction goes to zero. Here the softening zone is interpreted as a regularization of the crack network. Inside quiescent regions with no cracks or softening, the nonlocal operator converges to the local elastic operator at a rate proportional to the radius of nonlocal interaction. This model is designed to be calibrated to measured values of critical energy release rate, shear modulus, and bulk modulus of material samples. For this model one is not restricted to Poisson ratios of 1/4 and can choose the potentials so that small strain behavior is specified by the isotropic elasticity tensor for any material with prescribed shear and Lamé moduli.","tags":["Mathematical Modeling","Mechanics","Peridynamics","Fracture Mechanics"],"title":"Dynamic Brittle Fracture from Nonlocal Double-Well Potentials: A State-Based Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Lipton","Eyad Said","Prashant K.

The nonlinear peridynamic evolutions are shown to converge to the solution of linear elastodynamics at a rate linear with respect to the length scale $\\epsilon$ of non-local interaction. This rate also holds for the convergence of solutions of the linearized peridynamic model to the solution of the local elastodynamic model. For local linear Lagrange interpolation, the consistency error for the numerical approximation is found to depend on the ratio between mesh size $h$ and $\\epsilon$. More generally, for local Lagrange interpolation of order $p\\geq 1$, the consistency error is of order $hp∕\\epsilon$. A new stability theory for the time discretization is provided and an explicit generalization of the CFL condition on the time step and its relation to mesh size $h$ is given.

Continuum limit calculations serve two main purposes. First, they give an idea of how the macroscopic behavior of the material is related to the interactions at the atomistic scale. Second, they help in developing a multiscale numerical method, where the goal is to model the material both at the scale of atoms and at the macroscale.\nWe consider two important settings for the continuum limit calculation: nanorod- like materials, where the thickness of a material in the lateral direction is of the order of the atomic spacing, and the materials, where atoms are randomly fluctuating due to the thermal energy. Our calculations, for the nanorod-like materials, show that the electrostatics energy are not long-range in continuum limit. We also consider the discrete system of dipole moments along the straight line and along the helix. We then compute the limit of the energy as the separation between the dipole moments tends to zero. The energy, in the continuum limit, is short-range in nature. This agrees with the calculations of [Gioia and James, 1997] for the magnetic thin films. We consider the system of atoms which are fluctuating due to thermal energy. We model the charge density field as a random field and compute the continuum limit of the electrostatics energy.\nIn second part of the thesis, we present the Quasicontinuum method for the electro- mechanical deformation of the material at a finite temperature. There are two difficulties associated with this: one is the calculation of the phase average, and, second is the long-range interactions of the charged atoms. We use max-ent method presented in [Kulkarni et al., 2008] to formulate the problem as a minimization problem with respect to the atomic position and the atomic momenta. For the electrical interactions in the multi- scale method, we use the continuum limit of the energy for the random charge density field. We have modified the existing Quasicotninuum code, see [Marshall and Dayal, 2013], to implement the multiscale method. The code is an further extension of the code written by Jason Marshall [Marshall and Dayal, 2013].","tags":["Multiscale Modeling","Electrostatics","Quasicontinuum Method"],"title":"Coarse Graining of Electric Field Interactions With Materials","type":"publication"}]
